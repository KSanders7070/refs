### 5.2 Overlying Positions
The position directly overlying BKL is CLE-N (125.325) or whichever controller has responsibility over the position
### 5.3 Operational Hours
0700-2300L MON-SAT
0800-0000L SUN

### 5.4 General Operations
1. BKL is responsible for VFR operations within the BKL Class D Surface Area.
2. When verbally coordinated with CLE, BKL may conduct SVFR operations within the Class D surface area.
3. Without prior coordination, CLE may vector aircraft through that portion of the BKL Class D airspace as depicted in [figure 5-1](#figure-5-1---bkl-class-d-airspace-areas-a-illustration).
    - Area A from 2,200ft and above
    - Area B from 3,000ft and above
4. CLE authorizes BKL to utilize a certified TDW that may be utilized to provide radar service as deemed necessary IAW FAAO 7110.65 3-1-9.b. Additionally, LC shall issue radar traffic advisories IAW FAAO 7110.65 2-1-21a.

### 5.5 Departures
1. Hold all aircraft (Hold For Release) until released by CLE.
2. Coordinate approval requests through CLE for all non-standard departure routes and/or altitudes
3. Assign all IFR departures one of the following:
    - SID Departure
    - Standard Heading 350
    - Alternate heading assigned by CLE IAW the DVA (300-050)  

    If departing runway 24L and not on a SID, must issue the current departure procedure (ODP)
4. Assign departure aircraft 2,000ft and advise them to expect requested altitude ten (10) minutes after departure unless directed otherwise by CLE.



### 5.6 Arrivals
1. Assign missed approach aircraft 2,000ft and heading 350
2. Inform CLE of an unplanned missed approach prior to the aircraft reaching one (1) NM from the runway departure end.
