## General Procedures
1. CAK shall advertise a single departure runway in the ATIS
2. CAK surface area of responsibility is defined as a 5 NM radius around CAK from
surface up to and including 3000ft MSL. CAK surface area will include VFR
sequencing/pattern work within the area
    - CAK is authorized to provide visual separation within the surface area of
responsibility between arriving and departing aircraft.
3. VFR helicopters initiating contact with CAK for the purpose of landing or
overflying may be provided advisories and sequencing by CAK within the CAK
Surface Area of Responsibility. CAK will have control of the helicopter on
contact, but it must not affect the arrival sequence.
4. CLE authorizes SVFR operations within the CAK surface area of responsibility
5. CLE authorizes CAK to utilize a certified TDW that may be utilized to provide
radar service as deemed necessary, IAW FAAO 7110.65 3-1-9.b. Additionally, LC
shall issue radar traffic advisories IAW FAAO 7110.65 2-1-21.a.
6. CLE will ensure aircraft participating in Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO)
are IAW current LAHSO directives.


## Clearance Delivery

### Flight Data
1. CD must coordinate any route/altitude not in compliance with LOA routing.
2. Receive and disseminate weather information.
3. Prepare ATIS.
4. Process miscellaneous flight data information.
5. Accept requests for filing IFR flight plans.
6. Process and distribute flight plan information.
7. Issue clearance instructions.
8. Monitor and operate communications equipment on frequency: VHF - 132.05.

### Clearances
1.  When approach airspace is split, CD will issue 118.6 for aircraft entering S sector
airspace and 125.5 for aircraft entering E sector airspace, as depicted in CLE
7110.65N.
2. CD must issue the following as part of a clearance
    - Maintain 3000 and to expect requested altitude 10 minutes after departure.
    - VFR aircraft will be issued requested altitude except:
        - Requests at or below 3000 will be issued
            - "Maintain at or below 3000"
        - Requests higher than 3000 will be issued:
            - "Maintain 3000, expect higher with Departure"

## Ground Control

### General
1. GC is responsible for all movement areas on the airport except the runways, the northwest helipad, and the portion of the National Guard Taxiway designated as a movement area.
2. GC must monitor and use frequencies 121.7
3. GC may be authorized to assume the responsibilities of the non-advertised inactive runway by Local (this is a required item in the pre-position controller briefing)
4. GC will use the intersection departure distances in FIG. 4-1 for any aircraft that requests/or is willing to perform an intersection departure and shall be advised prior to taxi.

### Intra-Facility Coordiation
1. Operational requests
    - Prior to coordination, scan for traffic to ensure a request can be approved
    - Coordinate with the LC when an aircraft/vehicle is requesting to cross an active runway by stating the request and position; for example, “CROSS RUNWAY (number) AT (position)”. Report completion of the runway crossing to the appropriate LC in a timely manner
    - Coordinate all intersection Departures with LC

### Taxiway Routes and Restrictions
1. GC must protect the intersection of taxiways C and E for all aircraft that may use these movement areas to exit active runways.
2. GC may issue multiple runway crossing clearances in a single clearance for aircraft operating on Taxiway Kilo.


## Local Control

### General
1. Separation
    - Aircraft within the lateral and vertical limits of CAK delegated airspace.
    - Operations are conducted on active runways.
2. LC will have control of all runways, the northwest helipad, and the portion of the National Guard Taxiway that is designated a movement area
3. A controller may utilize the TDW IAW FAA Order 7110.65 paragraph 3-1-9, Use of Tower Radar Displays. TDW altitude filter limits must be set as a minimum from surface to 4000 ft MSL and quick look the CLE sector working the airspace.
4. LC must monitor and use the frequency 134.75.
5. LC will provide visual separation between aircraft when applicable.

### Departures
1. General
    - CAK shall issue “runway heading” and 3000 ft to all departures, unless otherwise coordinated
    - CAK delegates to CLE control for turns on departing aircraft.
2. IFR Release Procedure
    - CLE TRACON automatically releases all departures to CAK except for aircraft departing a non-advertised departure runway or on a diverging departure heading
    - Verbally request IFR release for aircraft departing the non-advertised departure runway and/or on diverging departure headings to the overlying controller

### Arrivals
1. Practice Approaches
    - LC must advise CLE TRACON of any practice approaches requesting a full-stop taxi-back. LC must coordinate a “rolling call” with CLE TRACON
2. Missed Approaches
    - LC must immediately climb the aircraft to 3,000ft MSL and instruct the aircraft to fly “Runway Heading” unless another heading is required due to traffic
    - LC must coordinate any unplanned missed approach with CLE TRACON
        - Include aircraft callsign and heading issued if other than runway heading
        - Transfer radar identification if necessary
