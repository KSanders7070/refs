## 12. FNT

### 12.1 Positions
| Callsign | Position | Radio Name | ID | Frequency |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| FNT_DEL | Delivery |  Flint Delivery | CD | 126.800 |
| FNT_GND | Ground |  Flint Ground | GC | 121.900 |
| FNT_TWR | Local |  Flint Tower | LC | 118.100 |

### 12.2 Overlying Positions
The position directly overlying FNT is AZO-B (118.800) or whichever controller has responsibility over the position. AZO will advise FNT if AZO-O is split.


### 12.3 Operational Hours
0545-2330L


### 12.4 General Operations
1. FNT is authorized to conduct local VFR operations at or below 2,500ft within the FNT Class C surface area. Local pattern traffic must not affect the arrival sequence established by approach control.
2. Except as required to avoid departures in the coordinated departure area, AZO is authorized to conduct operations at or above 3,000ft in the FNT Class C surface area without coordination.
3. AZO authorizes FNT to utilize a certified TDW that may be utilized to provide radar service as deemed necessary IAW FAAO 7110.65 3-1-9.b. Additionally, LC shall issue radar traffic advisories IAW FAAO 7110.65 2-1-21a.


### 12.5 Departures
1. Assign an expect further clearance of filed altitude 10 minutes after departure and the following initial altitudes:
    - IFR 3,000ft or requested lower altitude
    - VFR at or below 3,000ft
    - VFR-on-top VFR-on-top, not to exceed 3,000ft
    - SVFR at or below 2,500ft
2. Coordinate releases for any aircraft that will depart outside of the departure area or on a non-active runway with AZO. All departures, with the exception of SVFR, are served as automatic rolling boundary notification (no release required).
3. Assign headings or courses that fall within the departure area for the runway configuration [Figure 12-1](#figure-12-1-fnt-depature-area)
    - RWY 9 & 18: 060 clockwise to RWY HDG of RY18
    - RWY 9 & 36: RWY HDG of RWY 36 clockwise to 120
    - RWY 18 & 27: RWY HDG of RWY 18 clockwise to 300
    - RWY 27 & 36: 240 clockwise to RWY HDG of RY 36

### 12.6 Arrivals
1. Assign missed approach aircraft 3,000ft and a heading in the departure area.
2. Inform AZO of an unplanned missed approach prior to the aircraft reaching one (1) NM from the runway departure end.
3. Unless only one runway is designated as active, when visual approaches are being conducted, tower must state on the ATIS that approaches are being conducted to multiple runways.
