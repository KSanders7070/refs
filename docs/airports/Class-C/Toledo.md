### 24.2 Operational Hours
Continuous

### 24.3 General Operations
1. TOL must coordinate all IFR arrivals and departures to and from Erie-Ottawa International Airport (PCW) with CLE TRACON

### 24.4 Departures
1. Assign departure aircraft 5,000ft and advise them to expect requested altitude ten (10) minutes after departure.
2. Release aircraft on runway heading.
3. Adhere to routings and altitudes with all DTW and S21 satellite departures. ([Figure 25-2](#figure-25-1-toledo-tracon-delegated-airspace))

### 24.6 Arrivals
1. Local control assumes control of arriving aircraft sequenced by approach control:
    - ILS approaches - at the final approach fix (FAF)
    - Visual Approaches - from the final approach fix (FAF).
2. Assign missed approach aircraft 5,000ft and runway heading.
