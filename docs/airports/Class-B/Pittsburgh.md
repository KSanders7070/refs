# Ground Control

##  Scanning Movement Area

GC shall be aware of and operationally scan the work environment and following problem/restricted areas:

1. Two 747-400 aircraft cannot pass on the midfield perimeter TWYS (i.e., TWYS B and C; TWYS D and E; and, TWYS T and V).
2. All helicopter movements under control of LC shall be monitored carefully and subsequent aircraft movements shall be planned around these  helicopter movements by GC.

## Standard Taxi Routes

2. TWY V is a southbound only taxiway

## Plan Ground Movement
1. GC shall ensure to not allow aircraft to process on to a runway without transfer of control or approval from LC.
2. GC shall coordinate with LC all requests for intersection departures or secondary runway usage.
3. If non-standard runway departure is requested, GC shall coordinate with LC prior to taxi clearance.
4. GC shall give way to aircraft exiting runways unless otherwise coordinated. 
5. GC shall be made aware of local in-trail restrictions and as necessary: sequence traffic on taxiway to expedite departures. Sequencing aircraft  based off of routing shall be IAW [Flow Directions](#issue-clearances--amendments--instructions).

## Runway Crossing
1. Usage of active runway shall remain the responsibility of LC. GC shall NOT cross runways designated as active, unless coordinated and approved by LC.
2. When coordinating runway crossings, GC shall request by providing the runway number and intersection for which the aircraft shall be crossed. 
    - If the request is approved, LC shall explicitly state “cross” followed by the runway designation and intersection.
    - If the request is unable to be approved, LC shall NOT state “cross” but instead shall explicitly state “hold short of runway (designation)”
    - Upon crossing completion, GC shall advise LC by stating “crossing complete” followed by the controller’s operational initials (OIs).

### Split Ground Control

# Local Control

## Jurisdiction of Airspace
LC is responsible to ensure separation within a 7nm radius up to 5,000ft. MSL. DN/DS may utilize this airspace for turns IAW 6.4c/d.

## Departure Procedures
LC is responsible for ensuring initial separation between departures and other aircraft (i.e. successive departure, missed approach, VFR), and is permitted by DN/DS to automatically release aircraft except when AGC is landing on east flow. The following headings shall be assigned

|Runway|Routing|Depature Sector|Headings|
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
|Only one runway in use | Any | DN/DS | 190-360 (West) / 360-190 (East) |
| 28R | JST/EWC/TYROO | DN | 315-360 |
| 28R | BSV/South of JST | DN | 300 (RWY when 28C Closed) |
| 28C | Any | DN | RWY[^1] |
| 28L | BSV/JST/EWC/TYROO | DS | 260 |
| 28L | South of JST | DS | 190-245 |
| 10L | BSV/JST/EWC/TYROO | DN | 360-065 |
| 10L | South of JST | DN | 080 |
| 10C | Any | DN | RWY[^1] |
| 10R | BSV/JST/EWC/TYROO | DS | 120 |
| 10R | South of JST | DS | 135-190 |

- If an L1/L2 split is active: any other heading within a range 190-360°/360-190° may be issued upon approval through coordination so long as positive control is assured and the clearance is operationally advantageous. No two aircraft can be departed within the same heading range unless  15° of diverging separation is assured, and respectively coordinated. 
- L1 may assign any heading for RWY 14/32 that is within the RWYs 28L/10R and/or 28C/10C heading range(s). Separation shall be maintained for  departing aircraft on RWY 14/32 with other operating aircraft.
- A Diverse Vector Area (DVA) is established in 6.3.

[^1]: If 28R/L or 10L/R are closed, then 28C/10C may assume full range from RWY to the respective runway heading range

## Line Up and Wait (LUAW) Procedures

LUAW is authorized at PIT IAW FAA directives and under the following criteria:
- During daylight hours: LUAW is authorized for all runways.
- During night time hours: LUAW is authorized between sunset and sunrise only on RWY28L at TWY P so long as RWY 28L is only used for departures.
- If the reported weather ceiling is less than 800ft or the visibility less than 2sm then two separate aircraft shall not be both holding in position or cleared to land at the same time.
- When an aircraft is authorized to LUAW on a runway that intersects with another runway, traffic must be exchanged between that aircraft and any other aircraft authorized to LUAW, depart, or arrive on the intersecting runway

## Arrival Procedures
- AS/AN are not responsible for notifying LC of arriving aircraft unless the airspace is in low volume setting (less than 30acph) and an aircraft is bound for a primary departure runway in which AN/AS must obtain approval.
- LC shall ensure separation between all arriving aircraft and participating Class B aircraft, and is responsible for the final sequence of aircraft into the airport. 
- LC shall confirm radar identification of aircraft of each arrival and scan scratchpad information to correlate type of approach and runway assignment.
- When an arrival aircraft exits the runway, issue an initial taxi clearance that permits the aircraft to keep moving, clearing runway exits, without infringing on GC operation.

##  Reduced Separation Procedures

Reduced longitudinal separation of 2.5NM between aircraft established on the final approach course within 10NM of the landing runway is authorized for all runways except RWY 14. The following conditions must be met:
- The weight class of the leading aircraft is the same as or less than the trailing aircraft.
- Heavy aircraft and B757 are permitted to participate as the trailing aircraft only.

## Go Arounds and Missed Approaches
- LC must advise the departure sector (DN/DS) which will provide radar service to the aircraft executing a missed approach or go-around.
- LC must assign the aircraft 4,000ft and a heading (recommended to match the ranges defined by 5.2.a). The affected departure sector must be advised of this heading assignment prior to communication transfer.

## Tower Display Workstation (TDW)
PIT is equipped with a certified TDW that may be utilized to provide radar service as deemed necessary IAW FAAO 7110.65 3-1-9.b.

## Helicopter Operations
All movement areas are authorized for helicopter operations. When conducting helicopter operations LC shall coordinate with GC prior to issuing arrival/departure instructions to/from any location on the field other than active runways

## Land and Hold Short Operations (LAHSO)
PIT LC/radar shall NOT conduct LAHSO

## Local Split
###  Local 1 (L1)
L1 exercises control jurisdiction on RWYs 28L/10R, 28C/10C, and 14/32. L1 shall release aircraft IAW 5.2.

### : Local 2 (L2)
L2 exercises control jurisdiction of RWY 10L/28R. L2 shall release aircraft IAW 5.2, and is required to coordinate with L1 prior to releasing any departure when on *east* flow

# Radar
## Jurisdiction of Airspace
Jurisdiction for the radar airspace is graphically defined in Appendices 1 and 2

## Pre-Arranged Coordination Procedures (P-ACP)

DN/DS may permit only departures to penetrate AN/AS airspace, and are subject to the following limitations:
- DN/DS must quicklook the appropriate arrival position (AN/AS).
- DN/DS is responsible for lateral separation from all traffic.
- AN/AS must point out all primary targets, unassociated tracks, and associated tracks in coast status within their airspace to DN/DS. DN/DS must do the same with AN/AS.
- Aircraft under AN/AS jurisdiction must not re-occupy an altitude once vacated (descended through) without coordination with DN/DS.

## Diverse Vector Area (DVA)

Within the DVA, random vectors may be assigned to IFR aircraft below the Minimum Vectoring Altitude (MVA) IAW DVA procedure and facility directive. The PIT/AGC SID establishes DVAs. For obstruction clearance purposes, the following procedures must be used when applicable:

1. Aircraft departing any runway at PIT or AGC and in a climb at 200ft/NM may be vectored in any direction at or above 1,700ft MSL.
2. A SID does not apply to arrival aircraft. DVA and obstruction clearance methods must be applied to IFR aircraft on a go-around, break-out, or missed approach as follows:
    - Aircraft executing a go-around at or beyond the runway threshold and climbing to an assigned altitude at or above the MVA may be randomly vectored once at or above 1,700ft MSL.
    - “Break out” aircraft (taken off the final approach course prior to RWY threshold) below the MVA must be assigned an altitude at or above the MVA and vectored to avoid depicted obstructions..
    - Aircraft executing a published missed approach may only be randomly vectored at or above the MVA.

##  Departures
1. Departures exiting the PIT TRACON shall be IAW the PIT-ZOB LOA.
2. Aircraft transitioning from DN to DS (or vice versa) must clear the aircraft on a heading to enter the next airspace and handoff the track of the aircraft. Coordination may be achieved through scratchpad usage or verbal means.
3. Departure corridor (area defined in 5.1) usage in west flow: 
    - DS must make turns only in a counter-clockwise direction.
    - DN must make turns only in a clockwise direction.
    - Westbound departures remaining south of the CUTTA (northwest) corridor and north of the WISKE (southwest) corridor may be turned on course.
4. Departure corridor (area defined in 5.1) usage in east flow:
    - DS must make turns only in a clockwise direction.
    - DN must make turns only in a counter-clockwise direction.

## Pittsburgh (PIT) Arrivals
1. Arrivals entering the PIT TRACON are IAW the PIT-ZOB LOA.
2. AS/AN should only utilize runways designated as “arrival” runways. If not, AS/AN should obtain approval for runway use from LC.
3. The controller within whose airspace the final approach course lies is the approval authority of the sequence. Arrival controllers should stagger arrivals, utilizing visual separation as appropriate, when running parallel runway operations.
4. Breakout aircraft should be assigned an appropriate altitude to re-enter arrival airspace and vectored IAW 6.3.b.ii.
5. AS/AN are not responsible for notifying LC of arriving aircraft unless the airspace is in low volume setting (less than 30acph) and an aircraft is bound for a primary departure runway in which AN/AS must obtain approval.
6. AS/AN must transfer radar identification of an arriving aircraft to L1/L2 prior to the FAF.
7. Reduced longitudinal separation authorized for all runways except RWY 14 IAW 5.5.
8. When utilizing RWY 32 for arriving traffic in west flow, it is recommended to use the Converging Runway Display Aid (CRDA) feature in STARS to monitor arrivals landing RWY 28R.

## Satellite Arrivals
Any aircraft landing a satellite field shall be controlled by either DN/DS. IFR traffic landing at HLG shall be informed “radar service terminated” prior to switching the aircraft to the local control/tower frequency

## Vectors for Visual Approach

The following reported weather criteria are required in order to initiate vectors for visual approaches at these controlled airports:

1. PIT/BVI/AGC: minimum ceiling 2,300ft./visibility of 3sm.
2. HLG: minimum ceiling 2,400ft./visibility of 3sm
