3. Local IFR: aircraft requesting a “local” IFR (destination airports within the CLE terminal area) clearance shall be issued 4,000 feet and radar vectors to destination airport.
4. VFR Class B Departures: determine destination/direction of flight, clear aircraft “out” of CLE Class B, and maintain VFR at or below the following altitudes:
    | If on-course heading is: | Clear aircraft at or below: |
    | -- | -- |
    | 252 - 058 (Clockwise) | 2,500 |

2. When coordinating runway crossings, GC shall request by providing the runway number and intersection for which the aircraft shall be crossed.
    - If the request is approved, LC shall explicitly state “cross” followed by the runway designation and intersection.
    - If the request is unable to be approved, LC shall NOT state “cross” but instead shall explicitly state “hold short of runway (designation)”
