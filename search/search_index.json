Also, with more pilots using voice capabilities, one should consider the alias command system more as a tool rather than a communication method. Therefore, to avoid confusion between tools and communication, if information is going to be sent to a pilot in any manner, the command will be prefixed with a \u201cT\" for \u201ctext\" after the initial period.
